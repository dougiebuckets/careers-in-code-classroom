## Learning Policy
Each student will have up to $400 to spend on any APIâ€™s, web services, or learning materials that they would like. There is one rule for learning materials: you can choose any resource you would like to learn, but you must have at least one other person sign up for the course with you. This allows for more collaboration between the students and it gives you a partner to troubleshoot issues or problems you are having.
